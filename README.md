# Random_Picker
This code picks between two choices input by the user. There are two types of files available in this repository. There is the Python file, which you can open using a Python Launcher. The other file is a Unix Executable, which can be launched directly if you own a computer with a Unix operating system. I recommend the Python file for Windows users and the Unix Executable for Mac, Linux, and ChromeOS (not to be confused with the browser) users. Right now, you can only download the .zip file for the source code, which contains a broken executable (no idea how that happened) and a .py file (works fine).

Latest version: 1.0
